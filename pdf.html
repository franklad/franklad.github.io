                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Redesigned the deployment process for our deployment tool to enable dynamic multi-region deployments.
                        This was achieved by leveraging distributed agents and Kafka-based messaging.
                        The process is further secured with short-lived JWTs, ensuring enhanced security for distributed operations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Standardised and automated Docker image mirroring and custom base image creation. This enabled us to
                        have a consistent and secure base images across all our services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Designed authorization service inspired by the Zanzibar paper. This is one of the most challenging project
                        I've ever worked on. It took a lot of design sessions and iterations to really get it right.

                    <li>
                        Designed and developed a tool (Octomigrator) to help migrate our monorepo from GitLab to GitHub.<br>

                    <li>
                        Developed and maintained multi-threaded software for processing high-volume GPS data,
                        and other critical vehicle data, designed in C#.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tackled critical security bugs, as well as optimizing the caching mechanism that was responsible for the

                <p class="project">
                    I wrote this library in Go to help standardise running anything in parallel that implements the interface.
                    The interface is simple: Runnable() and Shutdownable(). It really helped me to have a cleaner code and a
                    better utilisation of resources like crons, workers, and other parallel tasks.

                <h3>[2022] neb</h3>
                <p class="project">
                    Created neb in Rust to speed up the bootstrapping process of any new Linux machine. I tend to have a fresh system
                    every six months, so I wanted to automate the process of setting up my environment. For most of the tools,
                    asdf (or mise) is used as a tool manager.

                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">
                    I mainly work with Go and Python on a daily basis.
                    However for my side projects, I pick technologies that
                    I find interesting and challenging. I've worked with Rust, C, C# and Haskell.
                    As an infrastructure engineer, I've worked with Terraform, AWS,
                    and have setup and maintained multiple production grade kubernetes clusters.
